# To-Do List v1

This is a small project I created as a beginner to practice **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It features a fully functional **To-Do List** where you can add and delete tasks with smooth animations.

The goal of this project was to get hands-on experience with:  
- Creating a responsive layout and centering content in the viewport  
- Handling basic interactivity with JavaScript (adding and removing tasks dynamically)  
- Styling with CSS including rounded elements, hover effects, and color themes  

This is a simple project, mainly for learning purposes, and I plan to keep improving my skills and building more advanced front-end projects in the future.  

Feel free to check it out and give feedback!
